# QLearning-DynaQ-Mutated-Versions
This Jupyter Notebook explores the implementation of Q-learning and Dyna-Q algorithms in reinforcement learning, specifically applied to the "CartPole-v1" environment from OpenAI's Gym. The notebook demonstrates the differences in performance and efficiency between the two algorithms through various visualizations and analyses.
